            <strong>Make the cheese sauce</strong>: Melt butter, then whisk in

            <strong>Make the topping</strong>: Melt two tablespoons of butter 
            in a skillet, add the bread crumbs, and toast until the crumbs 
            are brown. Spread the topping over the macaroni and cheese, 
            then sprinkle with paprika
        </li>
        <li>

    <p>This homemade mac and cheese recipe uses a classic mixture of 
        sharp Cheddar and Parmesan. Cheddar is a fantastic base, while 
        Parmesan adds a more complex and salty flavor. Of course, you 
        can adapt this recipe to suit your taste: Gruyere, Monterey Jack, 
        and Gouda are all great options for macaroni and cheese.</p>
